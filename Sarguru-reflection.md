What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    commit conventions and the terminology behind push/pull
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    Both those concepts were clarified very well
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    I asked about commit conventions, push/pull terminology, SHAs and using them to revert git repositories
What still confuses you about Git?
    I'm not used to the workflow of adding comments and approving pull request yet.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    It was positive despite the fact that my pair didn't show up.  Clint (my guide) did a really good job of making the best of the situation and jumping on teaching opportunities when I asked questions.
